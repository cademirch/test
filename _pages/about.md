I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department studying in the Integrative Carnivore Ecophysiology Lab with Dr. Terrie Williams. My research interests focus on how physiology can inform the conservation of marine predators, specifically in the context of targeted management and how habitat needs vary in response to human interaction or environmental change. My dissertation relates marine predator physiological constraints to their habitat use amidst conservation stressors like human disturbance and climate change induced deoxygenation using experimental and computational approaches. I am also interested in how dynamic ocean management can be better tailored to their systems, and to do so, am completing a systematic review and surveying end-users.  

I am also a student in the coastal science and policy designated emphasis program. Through this program, I am work to understand how to connect science to conservation needs and management applications. I'm interested in working at the interface between research and policy, and would like to apply my future work to direct management or conservation decisions.
